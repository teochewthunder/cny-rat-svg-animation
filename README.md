# CNY Rat SVG Animation 
This SVG is an example of timed animations using object properties. `fill = freeze` is used quite liberally here, to ensure that the animated object "freezes" in its end state until animated again.

## "2"
- use a line tag for the horizontal stroke.
- use a path tag with a bizier curve for the curved portion.

## "0"
- use the ellipse tag.

## Message
- Just a regular text tag.

## Animations
- some animations have ids. This is so that other animations can take reference from them.
